Suboptimal solution, sort, and then iterate and check if the difference between elements is 1.

Optimal solution, make a set, then iterate through each element of the set, and for each element(n), check if the n++ is in the set,
if it is, iterate until you dont find an element in the set. Number of those iterations is the length of the biggest consequtive set

Have to check if there is a number in the set that is smaller than n, becausee if there is, then n is not the start of a sequence. Optimization.

Memory O(n)
Space O(n)
