Strings are coded as:

<length_word>#<word>. Strings are decoded with two pointers. One is a global pointer that is incrementing through the whole word.
The other pointer incrmeents until it detects a # sign. Then the j-i gives us the length of the substring.  int(res[i,j-i]) is the length.
The substring is res[j+1;length].

O(n), time complexity
O(1), memory complexity
