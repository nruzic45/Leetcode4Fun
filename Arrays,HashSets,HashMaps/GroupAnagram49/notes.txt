Make a hashmap of this strucutre:
<string coded number of chars> => <vector of strings with the same key>
"1

It optimizes based on the fixed ammount of possible letters in
the english alphabet > 26. So the length of the key is always constant.

O(nxl), n the length of the input list, l -> max length of the string
O(nxl), memory required
