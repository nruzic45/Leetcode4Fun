The idea is two find two subsets with equal sums. That means that if we divide the total sum of array with 2,
(if the sum isnt divisible we return false), we obtain a target value of the subsets.

Finding a subset can be done with iterating through the elements and checking for each nums[i] element if the
sum of that element with the possible partial sum of the global set is equal to target. return true if yes, if not add the 
new acquired partial sums to the global set and iterate until you have exsauted the whole array.

Dynamic program is used with sets in this problem, as to not duplicate exsiting partial sums and for easer looking up
the allready computed partial sum in some prevous nums[i] to partial sum set relation.

O(n*sum(nums)) time
O(sum(nums)) memory
